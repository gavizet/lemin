## About

"Lem-in" is an algorithmic 42 school project. The goal is to find the quickest way to get n ants across the farm from room "start" to room "end", usint the shortest path available to you.

## How does it work ?

The program will receive information from the standard output. We will read the information given to us, analyze it, and depending on its validity, launch the program. If any of the informations given to us is invalid, we will stop the program and print "ERROR" on the standard output.

## Usage

> \> ./lem-in < [tests/test_file.map]

Example: "./lem-in < tests/sample2.map"

You will find pre-made test files in the "tests" directory.

* Makefile commands
  * 'make' => compile project
  * 'make clean' => delete object files
  * 'make fclean' => delete object and executable files
  * 'make re' => fclean delete && compile
